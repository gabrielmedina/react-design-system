# Templates

The template is the first stage of the Atomic Design methodology that does not align to a stage in the molecular world, but is important for Atomic Design. A template is where we begin to curate our organisms and other elements into a cohesive design.

You saw in the Organism stage that elements began forming into usable blocks of content, and those start coming together into a template of blocks that can be used across a variety of pages. Think of templates as the blueprint for our future finished page designs. At this point they’re still the elements, and won’t contain real data – much like a wireframe.

Building on our organism for the profile page, our template will now include a statistics organism showcasing some details about the profile – this could be actions taken, skill levels etc. There will also be a contact organism connected at the bottom. Using this, we now have a template for pages. This template is reusable across our application.
