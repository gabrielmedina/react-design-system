# Atoms

Just like in Chemistry, atoms are the smallest building blocks in our system. Rather than atoms like Oxygen or Hydrogen, in design we have buttons, inputs, labels and other small elements that get used throughout our design. Iconography fits in this category, whether it is a menu icon, or avatar as they’re small elements that come together to form the next stage – molecules.
