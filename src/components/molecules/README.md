# Molecules

In the molecule stage, we take our independent atomic design elements, each with their own characteristics, style, format, and begin to bring them together into new groupings. Take for instance our avatar atom. If we combine the avatar atom with name and title labels, other atomic elements, we can create a profile molecule. Each atom has carried its unique properties into a group that on itâ€™s own has distinct characteristics.

Just like in Chemistry, we can combine the same atoms in different ways to create unique molecules for use in our design. Though at this stage the groupings are still relatively simple collections.
