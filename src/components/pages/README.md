# Pages

Pages are the final stage of the Atomic Design methodology. This is where instances of templates are created (in this case, one for every profile). In the design process you may not design out pages for every instance, but it is helpful to create a few variations.

As your data changes, different profile information, or languages may impact your template design. Building out to the page stage allows you to test for these variations and make adaptations globally to your templates.

It is possible in some instances you won’t use all organisms in a template, whether a user doesn’t have those enabled, or they don’t apply, in the pages is where you would adjust what parts of the template are shown.

Pages are also where most clients, and internal stakeholders will be doing their reviewing of the design as you can see it all holistically in one place. Though it’s wise to share out at the template stage as well, having the full fidelity of your design together can help you spot weaknesses, or parts of the design that are not working well.
