# Organisms

As we enter the Organisms stage, our collections of atoms and molecules now become more complex than at the molecular level. Take for instance our ‘profile’ molecule. It was a simple element comprising an avatar and a pair of label elements. As we bring that into an organism, we may be adding that into an app header for a profile page, complete with navigation, a background cover photo and some other molecules. This creates our header organism.

The organism is not yet a complete design, but is a component that can be reused across designs, or layout templates.
